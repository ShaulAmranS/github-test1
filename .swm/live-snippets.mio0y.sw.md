## What are Live Snippets?

"Live Snippets" refer to fragments of code sourced directly from your repository, which are then seamlessly integrated into your documents. After installing your Swimm plugin ([VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Swimm.swimm) or [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20716-swimm)) - your documentation will be readily accessible within your IDE. Any Snippets incorporated into your document will consequently be identified in your code by the accompanying Swimm icon.
